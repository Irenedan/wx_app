In order to deal with the issue of scale, the DNS uses a large number of servers,
organized in a hierarchical fashion and distributed around the world. No single DNS
server has all of the mappings for all of the hosts in the Internet. Instead, the mappings are distributed across the DNS servers. To a first approximation, there are
three classes of DNS servers—root DNS servers, top-level domain (TLD) DNS
servers, and authoritative DNS servers—organized in a hierarchy as shown in Figure 2.19. To understand how these three classes of servers interact, suppose a DNS
client wants to determine the IP address for the hostname www.amazon.com. To
a first approximation, the following events will take place. The client first contacts
one of the root servers, which returns IP addresses for TLD servers for the top-leve
domain com. The client then contacts one of these TLD servers, which returns the
IP address of an authoritative server for amazon.com. Finally, the client contact
one of the authoritative servers for amazon.com, which returns the IP address
